# Bill-Management-System-Project
This is the final project that I made for my Class 12th CS practical.
This project performs the operations of calculation of a bill using all functions included in binary file.
It is based on the topic of file handling in Python. In total 5 different functions have been used:-
1.	Addition of a new record
2.	Display
3.	Searching on the basis of code
4.	Modify a record on the basis of Itemcode
5.	Deletion of a record on the basis of Itemcode
Measures have been already taken for invalid entries in the code.
